###*Movie Ticket Selling System*

CineTicket is an application for managing the selling of tickets in movie theathers. The
client-side of the application is written in [ExtJs 4](http://www.sencha.com/) and the server-side will be written in
Python.

This application is also an effort for mastering the essentials of [Application Architecture](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff650706.aspx), so I hope this will be useful for anyone with the same interest as this project is intended.
